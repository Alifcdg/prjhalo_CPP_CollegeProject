This is a simple college assignment using C++. 
The program simulates a resort administration system that collects visitor names.
The administrator asked to input the visitor's name and then asked whether there are other family members.
If there are additional visitors, their names will be added to the list.
When there are no more visitors, the program prints the complete list of guest names.
